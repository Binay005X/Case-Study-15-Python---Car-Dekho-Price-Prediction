# ðŸš— Project Overview â€“ Used Car Price Prediction

The used car market in India is highly dynamic, with prices fluctuating based on several factors such as car make, model, mileage, age, fuel type, transmission, condition, and market demand. This variability makes it challenging for sellers to set the right price and for buyers to assess whether a listed price is fair.

This project aims to solve that problem by building a Machine Learning Model that predicts the price of a used car based on its key features. Using a dataset of cars sold on CarDekho.com, the model is trained to learn historical pricing patterns and provide reliable price predictions for new listings.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Develop a predictive model for used car prices in India.

**Input**: Features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and condition.

**Output**: An accurate predicted price for the used car.

# âœ… Benefits

**For Sellers** : Helps set fair and competitive prices, increasing chances of faster sales and better profits.

**For Buyers**: Provides transparency to identify cars priced correctly and avoid overpriced listings.

**For the Market**: Encourages efficiency, trust, and competitiveness in Indiaâ€™s used car ecosystem.

This project combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning regression techniques to deliver a real-world solution to a highly relevant business problem.
